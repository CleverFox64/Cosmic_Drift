Comic Drift ~ To-Do List

/=============== Goal ===============/

The goal is to complete 2 puzzles one on each planet. (To scope down the game it's 2 puzzles instead of the full 4 or 5)

- I had to scope down the game to two puzzles due to time. A full version of the game would have had four to five puzzles.
For the sake of time in making this project for school it has to be cut in half and treated as a demo of the game. (Comic Drift)
(Even though making a second puzzle is going to take some time...)

- The second puzzle involves Tyler & Ana on the same planet.
Tyler needs to land on the planet to find more fuel while exploring and realizes that Ana is in trouble.
He needs to save her on a different part of the same planet.


/=============== Things To Do Next/Add ===============/

- Add the talking Sprites throughout the rest of the game (Playing as Joel)
- Add more dialogue interactions in the inventory w/ items when you're searching them or combining them
- Add more interactable hotspots throughout the world 



/=============== Bugs/Fixes ===============/

- Fix the other space members walking sprite (so the legs move up and down with the shoe)
- Fix the Spacesuit so the helmet glass is the only one that transparent and the outer parts of the helmet isn't
-
